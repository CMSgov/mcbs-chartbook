# MCBS Overview
The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) is the most comprehensive and complete
survey available on the Medicare population. Since 1991, the MCBS has collected data on
Medicare beneficiaries’ social and medical risk factors and the relationship between these
factors, healthcare utilization, and health outcomes – at a point in time and over time – directly
from beneficiaries. These data, linked with Medicare enrollment data and claims, provide
information not otherwise available through administrative data on the Medicare program and
can be used to evaluate effectiveness of health care policy and policy interventions.


The MCBS releases two Limited Data Set (LDS) files annually. All research requests for limited access data require a [Data Use Agreement (DUA)](https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/information-systems/privacy/data-use-agreement-dua) and can be requested through the process outlined here: [Limited Data Set (LDS) Files](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/files-for-order/limited-data-set-lds-files). The MCBS also releases two Public Use File (PUF) versions of the LDS files. These files, as well as accompanying documentation, are free to download and available on the [MCBS PUF page](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/mcbs-public-use-file). For additional information on the differences between these types of files, please visit [Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC)](https://resdac.org/articles/differences-between-rif-lds-and-puf-data-files). Additional documentation, including Questionnaires and Tutorials, is available on the [MCBS webpage](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/research/medicare-current-beneficiary-survey?redirect=/MCBS).

In addition to these data files, the MCBS regularly releases data tables, infographics, data briefs, and chartbooks. See the 'Quick Links' for detailed information on our data products.

## MCBS Survey File (LDS)  
### [Available Survey LDS files](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/files-for-order/limited-data-set-lds-files/medicare-current-beneficiary-survey-mcbs)
The MCBS Survey File contains over 6 thousand variables on a broad range of topics, including social determinants of health, economic outcomes, medication non-adherence, health insurance coverage and barriers to accessing care. The file is augmented with 5 years of enrollment data and, for beneficiaries enrolled in FFS Medicare, with 5 years of limited FFS claims. The MCBS Survey File (LDS) can be ordered here: [Limited Data Set (LDS) Files](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/files-for-order/limited-data-set-lds-files).

## MCBS Cost Supplement File (LDS)
### [Available Cost Supplement LDS files](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/files-for-order/limited-data-set-lds-files/medicare-current-beneficiary-survey-mcbs)
The Cost Supplement provides a comprehensive picture of beneficiaries’ health care use, expenditures, and sources of payment, including those not covered by Medicare. It contains both individual event and summary files and can be linked to the Survey File to conduct analyses on health care cost and utilization. The Cost Supplement File can support a broader range of research and policy analyses on the Medicare population than would be possible using either survey data or administrative claims data alone.
