# Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS)
The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) is a continuous, multipurpose survey of a nationally representative sample of the Medicare population, conducted by the Office of Enterprise Data and Analytics (OEDA) of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) through a contract with NORC at the University of Chicago. The central goals of the MCBS are to determine expenditures and sources of payment for all services used by Medicare beneficiaries, including co-payments, deductibles, and non-covered services; to ascertain all types of health insurance coverage and relate coverage to sources of payment; and to trace outcomes over time, such as changes in health status and spending down to Medicaid eligibility and the impacts of Medicare program changes on satisfaction with care and usual source of care. The MCBS provides important information on health outcomes and social determinants of health not available in the administrative program data.

MCBS data are made available via releases of annual files. For each data year, two annual LDS releases (the Survey File and the Cost Supplement File) and two PUFs (based on the Survey File and Cost Supplement File, respectively) are planned. The Survey File contains information on beneficiaries’ demographic information, health insurance coverage, self-reported health status and conditions, and responses regarding access to care and satisfaction with care. The Cost Supplement File contains a comprehensive accounting of beneficiaries’ health care use, expenditures, and sources of payment.
