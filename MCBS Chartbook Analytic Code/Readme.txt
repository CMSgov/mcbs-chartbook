(https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/research/mcbs/data-tables/2020-medicare-current-beneficiary-survey-annual-chartbook-and-slides)

The MCBS Chartbook provides the public with a collection of charts and tables presenting estimates 
from both the MCBS Survey File and Cost Supplement File. The Survey File contains data collected directly 
from respondents and supplemented by administrative items plus facility (non-cost) information and 
Medicare Fee-for-Service claims. The Cost Supplement File contains both individual event and summary 
files and can be linked to the Survey File to conduct analyses on health care cost and utilization.

The SAS code contained in this repository is used to create the MCBS Chartbook.
