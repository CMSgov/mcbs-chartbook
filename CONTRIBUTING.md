# How to Contribute

We're so thankful you're considering contributing to an [open source project of
the U.S. government](https://code.gov/)! If you're unsure about anything, just
ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is
you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate all friendly
contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its

## Getting Started
CMS provides users with multiple ways to access MCBS data:
* MCBS data are made available via two annual Limited Data Set (LDS) releases and Public Use Files (PUFs). 
* The MCBS LDS files require that users pay an administrative processing fee and require a DUA
* Requests for the MCBS LDS files must be made through the CMS Data Use Agreement (DUA) tracking
system known as the Enterprise Privacy Policy Engine (EPPE). EPPE can be used to initiate a new LDS
DUA request or to amend/update an existing LDS DUA.
* Upon request and formal approval, CMS releases the data on DVD or via the CMS Virtual Research Data
Center (VRDC). Each data release contains multiple data sets that are linkable through a key
identification variable (BASEID).
* In addition to the LDS files, MCBS data are made available to users through PUFs.
* The MCBS PUFs are free and available for download on the CMS website. 
* SAS codes from GitHub can be copied into SAS. Libname statement should be modified to point to the 
  data library before running the code.

### Security and Responsible Disclosure Policy

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is committed to ensuring the
security of the American public by protecting their information from

reporting vulnerabilities they have discovered so we can fix them and keep our
users safe. We developed our disclosure policy to reflect our values and uphold
our sense of responsibility to security researchers who share their expertise
with us in good faith.

*Submit a vulnerability:* Unfortunately, we cannot accept secure submissions via
email or via GitHub Issues. Please use our website to submit vulnerabilities at
[https://hhs.responsibledisclosure.com](https://hhs.responsibledisclosure.com).
HHS maintains an acknowledgements page to recognize your efforts on behalf of

researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.
